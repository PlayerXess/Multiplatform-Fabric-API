# Multiplatform Fabric API

A Solo Project Of Mine To Make A Version Of The Fabric API That Can Be Used On All Modloaders. Primarily made so people can use fabric functions in the :common directory of an Architectury API project.

Note: I am a single developer and trying to keep up with the FabricMC team on developing this would take all of my time. As such, I will only be adding features as I need them. If you have a feature of Fabric API that I haven't added yet, have encountered an error, or need me to update a function, please DM me on discord (@playerxess), or open a ticket on GitHub.

Legal Notice: I am not claiming that this code is mine. All I am editing (or at least planning to edit) will be the import statements so that this mod causes no issues when used with Fabric API in a Fabric environment. This project will be held under the same license as the Fabric API project itself to honor the teams wishes for their code.

Logistical notice: Why not just have the mappings be the same as fabric? This is because the functions code may change overtime and diverge from what it originally was. This will also allow a much simpler time setting up the mod. It's easier to just make it work everywhere than to have to notify players not to install the mod on Fabric/Quilt/Fabric-Like environments with FabricAPI.

Fabric API Base
